# Simon Game

Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design 
firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones 
and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and 
more complex. 
Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over. The original version was manufactured and distributed by 
Milton Bradley and later by Hasbro after it took over Milton Bradley. Much of the assembly language was written by Charles 
Kapps, who taught computer science at Temple University and also wrote one of the first books on the theory 
of computer programming. Simon was launched in 1978 at Studio 54 in New York City and was an immediate success, 
becoming a pop culture symbol of the 1970s and 1980s.
